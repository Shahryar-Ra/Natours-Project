Layout Exercise 07 // Tour company website with vanilla css

## so.. what was it about?
After several months of studying css and writing several simple projects, I wanted to experience a complete project with more animations and vanilla css tricks, like "selection box" or "checked box" hacks, or even popup menu with no JS; And I have to say, it was a fun way to learn how to use these things. 

I searched a lot to find a good project with good training and I found this project on udemy.com website in the Jonas Schmedtmann courses. great great instructor I must say.

This project uses a float layout and was a good practice for me to fully undrestand its functionality and plus it uses a SCSS preprocessor to write a clean and maintainable CSS file.

For naming convention and class naming methodology, Jonas suggested to use BEM architecture, It was a good introduction to BEM architecture for me, but i have to say after a while I feel overwhelmed by it. Class names starts to get confusing and ugly, so I began to search about it and I found ABEM [ Atomic BEM desgin ] methodology quite interesting. I will use it for my umcoming project for sure.

To anyone who intrested in learning advance vanilla css tricks I highly recommend Jonas Schmedtmann course and this project as well.
